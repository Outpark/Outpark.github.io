      <div class="description">Rescue is a colorful game that relaxes you from daily stress. It plays a beautiful stream of songs along with satisfying sound effects. It was originated from an idea to create a mind relaxing game that I can play without stress, but also something I wouldn't want quit so easily. As the "Ghost" rescues other souls, it absorbs their colors. Rescuing dark souls will eventually turn the Ghost to pitch black. Brighter ones, make it brighter.</div>

        Makey Makey is an electronic invention kit that can basically connect any conductive material to the keyboard. Objects such as play-doh, bananas, even pencial traces and send electric signals to the board and to the machine. Leveraging Makey Makey, I can hook up play-doh to the game and use them as physical controllers.
