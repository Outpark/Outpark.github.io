  description: "Rescue is a colorful game that relaxes you from daily stress. It plays a beautiful stream of songs along with satisfying sound effects. It was originated from an idea to create a mind relaxing game that I can play without stress, but also something I wouldn't want quit so easily. As the 'Ghost' rescues other souls, it absorbs their colors. Rescuing dark souls will eventually turn the Ghost to pitch black. Brighter ones, make it brighter."
