        <title>Up and ruuning, my blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Finally setted up my blog. It took me a great deal of time to figure out which website generator to use. I&amp;rsquo;ve had some expriences with WordPress which I am using as a travelog and a diary. But I wanted something lighter, static, and simple that I can put up on GitHub. Hexo and Jekyll seemed to be the perfect match. Well then, which one between them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar aspects are shared, such as Markdown support. It is great Hexo is built with Node.js which I am more familiar with than Ruby. However due to its recent birth, Hexo, at the moment, possesses fewer themes available and has a smaller community than Jekyll. Plus, I found this nice and simple theme made by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/muan&quot;&gt;muan&lt;/a&gt;. So, for now, at least, I&amp;rsquo;m going with Jekyll. &lt;/p&gt;
